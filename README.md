# Go Common

A Common Library used to abstract models, packages, utils and basic implementation out of the main codebase to
maintain a standard codebase.

___

**This project was written in go@1.22.0**

## Usage

- To use the library the following needs to be set:
### NetRC
A .netrc file is a mechanism used to store 
authentication-related information for remote servers. 
It typically resides in the userâ€™s home directory. 
This file is widely used in Unix systems and by tools like curl.

To set this up run:
```shell
echo "machine github.com login <github_username> password <github_access_token>" > ~/.netrc
```

## GitConfig
The developers ~/.gitconfig file should contain the following:
```text
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
        insteadOf = https://github.com/
```

## Go ENV
Typically after setting up the network the developer should set up their GOPRIVATE variable,
This tells go-toolchain to fetch data from a specific private source.

### Project Level
```shell
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/shiroyaavish/*
```

### Global
```shell
go env -w "GOPRIVATE=github.com/shiroyaavish/*"
```

## Implementations
